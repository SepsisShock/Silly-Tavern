**FOR CHAT COMPLETION**, meant for Deepseek direct API. Not sure how well they work on Open Router providers.

Sepsis-Deepseek-R1-0324-Chimera-V1 is the most current one as of 5/29/25, played around with it on R1, but not extensively yet.

~~This preset is meant for Deepseek V3 0324 (not regular V3.) Deepinfra via Open Router. I have heard V5 works okay for direct Deepseek API, but set temperature to .30.~~

~~DO NOT USE FOR R1 OR VIA DIRECT API. You can, but it will probably act absolutely psychotic.~~

~~I'm changing this almost weekly because what's working one week isn't working the next... also because I struggle with keeping it short.~~

Some peompts seem weak and that's on purpose. I want to encourage some behaviors, but not get overwhelmed by it.
