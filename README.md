**FOR CHAT COMPLETION**, NOT TEXT COMPLETION. All the ones with a **"B" at the end are the hybrid R1/0324 presets**.

~~This preset is meant for Deepseek V3 0324 (not regular V3.) Deepinfra via Open Router. I have heard V5 works okay for direct Deepseek API, but set temperature to .30.~~

~~DO NOT USE FOR R1 OR VIA DIRECT API. You can, but it will probably act absolutely psychotic.~~

I'm changing this almost weekly because what's working one week isn't working the next... also because I struggle with keeping it short.

Some peompts seem weak and that's on purpose. I want to encourage some behaviors, but not get overwhelmed by it.
